# Moonshot.Express Platform

####The collaboration platform for moonshot.express

## Description
This platform is the backbone of Moonshot.Express. Quests are defined and rewards are issues on this platform.

## Project status
We just got started. This is what the project timeline looks like:

- June 21st: Basic funcationalities: MetaMask integration for registation and authentication, an overview of the Pioneers (members of moonshot.express) and a map of the location of the Pioneers.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the [Includable CLI](https://docs.includable.com/getting-started/cli/) installed: `npm install -g includable`
2. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/th3build/moonshot-platform.git`
3. Go to the root of the directory `cd moonshot-platform`
4. Install the dependencies `npm install`
5. Run the module: `inc run`

Keep the terminal command running in the background, and you can start developing.


## Implementation details

* React (JSX and ES2016) code (in `web/app/` directory) is compiled using Babel and Webpack.
* Routing within the app is done using `react-router`.
* AJAX requests are done using `axios`.


## Tips

* Check the `inc run` output for any babel, browserify or browser javascript errors.
* Open your Chrome dev tools and check the box 'Disable cache' in the 'Network' tab to make sure the latest version of your code is loaded when you refresh. Also, remember that it takes a second or two from the moment you save before the new javascript bundle is compiled and uploaded.
